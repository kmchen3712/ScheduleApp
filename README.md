# notesApp
Built with HTML, CSS, JS

This is my first personal project along my journey to master Web Development.

I'll be using HTML, CSS, and JS to build a Schedule Web App. The vision of this web app is not to be pretty, but to be functional. The app will help me prepare my schedule so that I can easily fill in the missing details.

Onwards to coding! ðŸš€
